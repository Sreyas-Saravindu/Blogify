Prerequisites:
1.Node.js and npm: Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the Node.js official website.
2.Project Folder: You should have a Node.js project folder that contains your project files, including a package.json file.

Steps to run:
1.Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project folder. You can do this by opening a terminal or command prompt and using the cd command. 
2.Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the project's dependencies as specified in the package.json file: npm install ejs express body-parser
3.Run the Project: The command to run your project can vary depending on how your project is set up. Commonly, you will find a start script defined in the package.json file. To run the project, use: npm start
If the start script is not defined, you may need to run the entry point file directly, typically index.js or app.js, using: node index.js
